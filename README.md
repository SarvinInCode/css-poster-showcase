# Poster by Sarvin — "Made with Code & Love"

A creative poster designed using only HTML and CSS, combining the elegance of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and handcrafted shapes to form a playful, artistic layout.

This project explores visual expression through code — where each element is carefully placed, colored, and animated to create balance, contrast, and rhythm.
